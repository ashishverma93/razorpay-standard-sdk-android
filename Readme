This is the Sample App for Razorpay SDK Integration. Please replace the dynamic values.
Below are the steps for implementing razorpay standard sdk:
1. Add the below razorpay dependency:
    // https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.razorpay/checkout
    implementation 'com.razorpay:checkout:1.6.29'
    You can find the latest version on the below URL:
    https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/payment-gateway/android-integration/standard/build-integration/#11-install-razorpay-android-standard-sdk

2. Add the below line in the Activity where razorpay checkout implemented:
   Checkout.preload(applicationContext)
   Checkout.sdkCheckIntegration(this)

3. Implement 'PaymentResultWithDataListener' Interface and override the below methods:
    a. onPaymentSuccess(razorpayPaymentID: String, paymentData: PaymentData)
    b. fun onPaymentError(code: Int, p1: String, paymentData: PaymentData)

4. Create Razorpay Order from your server end to razorpay dashboard

5. Once the razorpay_order was created, execute razorpay checkout code

6. Once the payment was successfully done and receive onPaymentSuccess response from razorpay sdk,
   call your server API to verify and capture the payment

7. After Verify and capture the payment execute your remaining business logic.
